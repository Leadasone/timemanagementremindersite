   	  	Time Management Definition
“Time management” is the process of organizing and planning how to divide your time between specific activities. Good time management enables you to work smarter – not harder – so that you get more done in less time, even when time is tight and pressures are high. Failing to manage your time damages your effectiveness and causes stress.

This will work by inputting your schedule so you'll able to improve your time management while doing your activities. Moreover, it may lessen the pressure and stress so it won't affect the outcome of your works. This will be also the way toward getting sorted out and arranging how to split your time between leisure and academic activities. Additionally, you may complete more in less time, in any event, when time is tight and pressure is high.
